Interface Builder is basically a built-in tool in Xcode. Here, we navigated through Interface builder, added elements onto the canvas, and interacted with those elements in the code.
In storyboard, we created a screen where text is displayed using Text field and Button which has outlets and actions functions is used here. On, clicking button a text pop ups!
